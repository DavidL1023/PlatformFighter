# Platform Fighter
Is a little game for me to get used to some object oriented programming in Python. It's my first serious/personal programming project.

## Dependencies
### [pygame](https://github.com/pygame/)

## How To Use
Once you have the repository, just run the client with Python interpreter. WASD to move, left click to shoot, ESC to bring back the main menu. There's also some stuff you can mess around with in the settings file, including a tilemap for changing the map layout.
