# My first serious programming project

Is a platform fighter for me to get used to some object oriented programming in Python

## Whoah test
  - Whoah

My plans for the game
  - add screen shake and music and death animation

  - add sword function and pick up weapon function, with a sword you can cut arrows(destroy them)

  - shield? im thinking when you get hit blood particles or something

  - I want camera to slightly move around where you are on map

  - change bullet to arrow and add hold for 2 seconds to shoot, gravity, ammo counter for bow

  - When you are against a wall you can hop off of it~! add a crouch?

  - convert to exe for players

  - leave pvp for multiplayer
