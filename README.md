# Platform Fighter
Is a little game for me to get used to some object oriented programming in Python. It's my first serious/personal programming project. What I learned is that starting projects like this is hard, working on it once you're used to it is pretty fun, but then trying to finish it can be torture. For example, I wanted to add LAN functionality but there isn't much online about pygame and adding multiple clients, so it became torture and I just ended the project without it. Just added a crappy AI instead! I'll make a multiplayer game in the future using an actual game engine. 

# Dependencies
### / [pygame](https://github.com/pygame/) /

## How To Use
Once you have the repository, just run the client with Python interpreter. WASD to move, left click to shoot, ESC to bring back the main menu. There's also some stuff you can mess around with in the settings file, including a tilemap for changing the map layout.
